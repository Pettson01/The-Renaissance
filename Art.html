     <h1> What changed in art in the Renaissance </h1>
     <br>
     <p> In the renaissance art changed drastically and more art and sculptures of the human body and nature were drawn and created. The renaissance was the starting point of rejecting formal scholasticism of the prevailing Christian theology and creating something closer to nature. This idea of rejecting the Christian theology art style and drawing something closer to nature and the human body was a revolutionary and more art of the sort were made. One of the most famous artists that made both art with Christian theology and about the human body and nature was Leonardo da Vinci.  </p>
