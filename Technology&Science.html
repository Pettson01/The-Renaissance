<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p>
The Renaissance was a period of advances in technology and science in various areas. Medicine, astronomy and geography were some of the areas which were advanced in the renaissance period. Within medicine they did experiments on the human body to extend their knowledge about it. In astronomy there were many great scientific advances, there were new theories about the solar system and there were discoveries about new stars and sunspots. The printing press was also invented in the Renaissance and it was invented by a German man named Johannes Gutenberg. The Renaissance was an era of great men such as Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo Galilei, Filippo Brunelleschi and many more.

<h1> Astronomy </h1>
<p>
  Around the end of the Renaissance the man called Galileo Galilei
  who was a scientist in his age invented a telescope. When Galilei
  found out that there was an object which could enhance you view
  length by many times, he was so intrigued that he studied it all
  night. He built one himself which had three times the zoom of a
  normal eye, and as time passed he enhanced it to 33 times magnification.
  With this newly created “binoculars” he looked up in the sky
  which led him to extraordinary discoveries. Galilei discovered
  that there was an uncountable number of stars, the craters and
  mountains on the moon, the planet Venus different phases, what
  looked like Saturn’s rings and many more discoveries. Galilei
  published “Sidereus Nuncius” which was a short astronomical book
  that featured his early discoveries using the telescope which he
  made. This is a picture from “Sidereus Nuncius” that shows the moons different phases.

  The many ideas about how the planets and stars
   were aligned were changed during the Renaissance by different
   people. It was believed that the earth was in the middle of the
   Milky Way and not the sun, this was because of the Catholic Church
    which deemed a new model of the universe would border upon
    blasphemy. The idea that the sun lays in the centre of our universe
    came from Copernicus which later in the Renaissance was built
     on by Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei in various ways.
     Johannes Kepler believed that the universe was geometrically
      perfect and that it could be described mathematically which
       would be much better instead of using epicycles within epicycles
       on a model.

<h1> Medicine </h1>
<p>
  During the Renaissance experiments on the human body was done, they
  dissected the human body to extend their knowledge about human anatomy.
  One of the greatest contributors to knowledge about human anatomy is
  Leonardo Da Vinci, who also was an artist that was skilled at drawing
  the human body. In the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence Leonardo
  was given permission to dissect human corpses which led him to write
  13 000 words and paint more than 240 pictures about the human anatomy
  during the year he was at the hospital. Leonardo's drawings consist
  of the human skeleton and its parts, muscles, sinews, the heart, the
  sex organs and other parts of the anatomy. If Leonardo Da Vinci’s
  drawings would have been published they would have been a great
  contribution to medical science, all was not published
  but some were. When Leonardo Da Vinci died his heir
  took over the work of compiling all of his work to a
  treatise but only a small amount of what Leonardo had written down
  was included in his treatise on painting because of Leonardo's
  unique writing style. If you look closely on these pictures below
  you can see how Leonardo wrote, it looks quite hard to read if you ask me.

  <br> <br>

  It can be seen in these pictures that Leonardo Da Vinci was very skilled
  in drawing three-dimensional drawing of the human body. This was because
  of his studies of the anatomy of the human body as an apprentice of Andrea
  Del Verrocchio. Andrea Del Verrocchio demanded that all of his students
  would establish a good grasp of the anatomy of the human body which leads
  Leonardo who was an artist to quickly become a master of topographic anatomy.
  The pictures show the human brain, a fetus and the skeleton all from
  Leonardo Da Vinci’s drawings.

As for a conclusion, the Renaissance was a period of
 technological and scientific advances and most
  noticeable would be within the fields of astronomy
  and medicine. Did you know that the printing press
   dates back to 1439, it was made by a German man named
    Johannes Gutenberg? This picture which you probably
    have seen before came from the Renaissance
    and it was painted by Leonardo Da Vinci, the
    left one that is. When speaking of Leonardo,
     he did make a design for a flying machine in
      1488 which you can see in this picture.
