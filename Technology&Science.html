<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p>
The Renaissance was a period of advances in technology and science in various areas. Medicine, astronomy and geography were some of the areas which were advanced in the renaissance period. Within medicine they did experiments on the human body to extend their knowledge about it. In astronomy there were many great scientific advances, there were new theories about the solar system and there were discoveries about new stars and sunspots. The printing press was also invented in the Renaissance and it was invented by a German man named Johannes Gutenberg. The Renaissance was an era of great men such as Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo Galilei, Filippo Brunelleschi and many more.

<h1> Astronomy </h1>
<p>
  Around the end of the Renaissance the man called Galileo Galilei
  who was a scientist in his age invented a telescope. When Galilei
  found out that there was an object which could enhance you view
  length by many times, he was so intrigued that he studied it all
  night. He built one himself which had three times the zoom of a
  normal eye, and as time passed he enhanced it to 33 times magnification.
  With this newly created “binoculars” he looked up in the sky
  which led him to extraordinary discoveries. Galilei discovered
  that there was an uncountable number of stars, the craters and
  mountains on the moon, the planet Venus different phases, what
  looked like Saturn’s rings and many more discoveries. Galilei
  published “Sidereus Nuncius” which was a short astronomical book
  that featured his early discoveries using the telescope which he
  made. This is a picture from “Sidereus Nuncius” that shows the moons different phases.
