    <h2>Class diffrens</h2>
    <p>In the beginning of the renaissance the people were divided in different social classes.<br>
Highest up on the scale were the nobles who lived in large manors outside the city wall and owned most of the land. The nobles worked as military officers, royal advisers and politicians. There were certain qualityâ€™s a noble had to know, a noble had to be a trained warrior, they had to have social talents such as wit and they had to know how to dance.<br><br>
The next class were the merchants who gained there wealth in industries. They sought to protect their wealth by controlling the government, the merchants tried to climb the social ladder by marrying in to noble houses. Many merchants were patrons of great artists to gain public favor.<br><br>
Then we have the tradesmen, they were craft workers and shopkeepers. Most tradesmen belonged to guilds, an organization that established standards of quality, set rules for membership, and limited outside competition.<br><br>
The lowest class of city workers were the unskilled workers. They had no job protection which meant that they had to depend on their employer and if they broke the rules their wages could be withdrawn or they could get fired if the employer felt that way.<br><br>
Even if unskilled workers seemingly had horrible work conditions they were does who had it worse, the peasants were the lowest of low. They lived in the rural areas. The poorest of the peasants were the sharecroppers who worked on the nobles land. Life on a farm was not easy and the peasants were no strangers to starvation
