    <p>Marriage was starting to be an act of love but for the most part it was just a social contract, even though it was nothing romantic about the union it was still a happy grand celebration with lots of food and entertainment.<br><br>
The women at the time got some changes in their life, not much but still some small changes. They were still supposed to cline the house, watch the children and give birth to boys but they were allowed to have their own opinions they were even expected to.<br><br>
The food went through some development during the renaissance, not so much for the lower class but the higher class started to import new world ingredients like potatoes and chili. Another change is that they introduced forks to utensils and started to use wood, metal and later porcelain as plates instead of steal bread.

    <h2>Social Classes</h2><br>
    <p>In the beginning of the renaissance the people were divided in different social classes.<br><br>
Highest up on the scale were the nobles who lived in large manors outside the city wall and owned most of the land. The nobles worked as military officers, royal advisers and politicians. There were certain qualityâ€™s a noble had to know, a noble had to be a trained warrior, they had to have social talents such as wit and they had to know how to dance.<br><br>
The next class were the merchants who gained there wealth in industries. They sought to protect their wealth by controlling the government, the merchants tried to climb the social ladder by marrying in to noble houses. Many merchants were patrons of great artists to gain public favor.<br><br>
Then we have the tradesmen, they were craft workers and shopkeepers. Most tradesmen belonged to guilds, an organization that established standards of quality, set rules for membership, and limited outside competition.<br><br>
The lowest class of city workers were the unskilled workers. They had no job protection which meant that they had to depend on their employer and if they broke the rules their wages could be withdrawn or they could get fired if the employer felt that way.<br><br>
Even if unskilled workers seemingly had horrible work conditions they were does who had it worse, the peasants were the lowest of low. They lived in the rural areas. The poorest of the peasants were the sharecroppers who worked on the nobles land. Life on a farm was not easy and the peasants were no strangers to starvation
