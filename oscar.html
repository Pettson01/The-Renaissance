      <p> The Renaissance was an age where the idea of Countries, Monarchies and borders really began to develop. The idea of state supremacy and competition between countries is also something which really began to bloom in these ages, increasing competition in many areas such as Trade, Economy and land ownership. This competition between nations increased the tension and would eventually lead to War; something which also was very common in these ages. </p>
