          <p> These wars stand out because they involved many countries and had large consequences to the political powers in Europe. The Hundred Years‚Äô War was as the title suggests, a war that lasted 100 years. This war largely involved England and France, and was one of the reasons the rivalry between the 2 nations got started. The consequences of this war are largely:
<br><br>‚Ä¢	Both the Countries gain national identities
<br><br>‚Ä¢	France begins building up the size of its army
<br><br>‚Ä¢	The Feudalistic market system was destroyed
<br><br>‚Ä¢	The English became Anti-French, something which was continued until the First World War.
<br><br>‚Ä¢	The English get removed from mainland Europe, so they instead focus on creating an overseas empire.

      <p> The Renaissance was an age where the idea of Countries, Monarchies and borders really began to develop. The idea of state supremacy and competition between countries is also something which really began to bloom in these ages, increasing competition in many areas such as Trade, Economy and land ownership. This competition between nations increased the tension and would eventually lead to War; something which also was very common in these ages. </p>

              <h2> Wars & Conflicts </h2>
              <p>A lot of conflicts between the countries in the Renaissance were solved by War. Whether it be land disputes or simply a part being displeased with a trade deal, it‚Äôs safe to say there were lots of wars. A few of the more notable ones are: <br><br>‚Ä¢   The Hundred Years‚Äô War<br><br>‚Ä¢   The Thirty Years‚Äô War<br><br>‚Ä¢ The Great Northern War</p>
