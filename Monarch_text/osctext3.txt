These wars stand out because they involved many countries and had large consequences to the political powers in Europe. The Hundred Years’ War was as the title suggests, a war that lasted 100 years. This war largely involved England and France, and was one of the reasons the rivalry between the 2 nations got started. The consequences of this war are largely:
<br><br>•	Both the Countries gain national identities
<br><br>•	France begins building up the size of its army
<br><br>•	The Feudalistic market system was destroyed
<br><br>•	The English became Anti-French, something which was continued until the First World War.
<br><br>•	The English get removed from mainland Europe, so they instead focus on creating an overseas empire.
