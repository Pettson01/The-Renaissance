      <h2> Introduction </h2>

      <p> The renaissance was a fervent period of the European culture and had a big role in European history. The word Renaissance actually means “rebirth” in French which is the cause of this whole literal period. The renaissance started in Florence, Italy and took place from 14th century to the 17th century, lasting a whole of 3 decades. This era has a great history about art, literature and philosophy. During this literal period, a cultural movement called Humanism began to rise in Italy. Among its many concepts, humanism promoted the idea that the man was in the center of his own universe, and that people should embrace human achievements in different ways such as art and literature. <h2> What started it all? </h2> <p>

      <p> It all began around the year 1350 and ended at the start of the 16th century. A small cultural movement took place in a city called Florence located in Italy, but later on spread throughout Europe. This time period is well known for its changes in art, literature and other things. During the time that the renaissance was taking place in Italy, the rest of Europe experienced the Medieval Times, more commonly known as the Dark Ages. The Dark Ages was one of the worst time periods in history, the main causes being war, famine, and a lot of bad diseases such as the Bubonic Plague, also known as “The Black Death”. It was during this time period that the Humanists emerged. These people had a different view of the world and saw things from a different perspective. They believed that people had important contributions to make the world a better place. Most of their ideas came from the ancient Greek and Romans, which inspired their new ideas to become even better. <p>

       <h2> Humanism </h2>

       <p> During the 14th century, the cultural movement called humanism took place. It all started in the same city as the renaissance started, located in Florence, Italy. One of its many theories was that the human was in the center of the universe and that the people should embrace and look up to human achievements in literature, education and science. In the middle of the 14th century, around the year 1450, a scientist named Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press, very similar to the modern printers that we have today. The printing press allowed the ideas of inventions to spread more quickly and it also improved the communication throughout Europe. The results of the printing press led to other big names such as Francesco Petrarch and Giovanni Boccaccio starting to promote the renewal of traditional Greek and Roman culture, were printed to the mass people. This then later on helped the culture to grow and become what it became for the rest of The Renaissance. <p>
