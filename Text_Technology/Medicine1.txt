During the Renaissance experiments on the human body was done, they
dissected the human body to extend their knowledge about human anatomy.
One of the greatest contributors to knowledge about human anatomy is
Leonardo Da Vinci, who also was an artist that was skilled at drawing
the human body. In the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence Leonardo
was given permission to dissect human corpses which led him to write
13 000 words and paint more than 240 pictures about the human anatomy
during the year he was at the hospital. Leonardo's drawings consist
of the human skeleton and its parts, muscles, sinews, the heart, the
sex organs and other parts of the anatomy. If Leonardo Da Vinci’s
drawings would have been published they would have been a great
contribution to medical science, all was not published
but some were. When Leonardo Da Vinci died his heir
took over the work of compiling all of his work to a
treatise but only a small amount of what Leonardo had written down
was included in his treatise on painting because of Leonardo's
unique writing style. If you look closely on these pictures below
you can see how Leonardo wrote, it looks quite hard to read if you ask me.

It can be seen in these pictures that Leonardo Da Vinci was very skilled
in drawing three-dimensional drawing of the human body. This was because
of his studies of the anatomy of the human body as an apprentice of Andrea
Del Verrocchio. Andrea Del Verrocchio demanded that all of his students
would establish a good grasp of the anatomy of the human body which leads
Leonardo who was an artist to quickly become a master of topographic anatomy.
The pictures show the human brain, a fetus and the skeleton all from
Leonardo Da Vinci’s drawings.
