Around the end of the Renaissance the man called Galileo Galilei
who was a scientist in his age invented a telescope. When Galilei
found out that there was an object which could enhance you view
length by many times, he was so intrigued that he studied it all
night. He built one himself which had three times the zoom of a
normal eye, and as time passed he enhanced it to 33 times magnification.
With this newly created “binoculars” he looked up in the sky
which led him to extraordinary discoveries. Galilei discovered
that there was an uncountable number of stars, the craters and
mountains on the moon, the planet Venus different phases, what
looked like Saturn’s rings and many more discoveries. Galilei
published “Sidereus Nuncius” which was a short astronomical book
that featured his early discoveries using the telescope which he
made. This is a picture from “Sidereus Nuncius” that shows the moons different phases.
