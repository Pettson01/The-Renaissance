The many ideas about how the planets and stars
 were aligned were changed during the Renaissance by different
 people. It was believed that the earth was in the middle of the
 Milky Way and not the sun, this was because of the Catholic Church
  which deemed a new model of the universe would border upon
  blasphemy. The idea that the sun lays in the centre of our universe
  came from Copernicus which later in the Renaissance was built
   on by Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei in various ways.
   Johannes Kepler believed that the universe was geometrically
    perfect and that it could be described mathematically which
     would be much better instead of using epicycles within epicycles
     on a model.
