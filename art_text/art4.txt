The last super is a famous Christian masterpiece, which showcases Jesus last supper he gave to his followers. This is the first art-piece Leonardo made in this size. This painting was drawn on dry plaster wall with experimental pigments. This painting has had a lot of problems though, it has been flaking and the color has disappeared under the years. It has been restored countless times and not itâ€™s said it not even close to the original masterpiece it once was. The last supper was drawn in 1495.
