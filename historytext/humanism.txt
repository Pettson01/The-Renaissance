During the 14th century, the cultural movement called humanism took place. It all started in the same city as the renaissance started, located in Florence, Italy. One of its many theories was that the human was in the center of the universe and that the people should embrace and look up to human achievements in literature, education and science. In the middle of the 14th century, around the year 1450, a scientist named Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press, very similar to the modern printers that we have today. The printing press allowed the ideas of inventions to spread more quickly and it also improved the communication throughout Europe. The results of the printing press led to other big names such as Francesco Petrarch and Giovanni Boccaccio starting to promote the renewal of traditional Greek and Roman culture, were printed to the mass people. This then later on helped the culture to grow and become what it became.
