The renaissance was a fervent period of the European culture and had a big role in European history. The word Renaissance actually means “rebirth” in French which is the cause of this whole literal period. The renaissance started in Florence, Italy and took place from 14th century to the 17th century, lasting a whole of 3 decades. This era has a great history about art, literature and philosophy. During this literal period, a cultural movement called Humanism began to rise in Italy. Among its many concepts, humanism promoted the idea that the man was in the center of his own universe, and that people should embrace human achievements in different ways such as art and literature.
