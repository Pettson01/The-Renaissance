It all began around the year 1350 and ended at the start of the 16th century. A small cultural movement took place in a city called Florence located in Italy, but later on spread throughout Europe. This time period is well known for its changes in art, literature and other things. During the time that the renaissance was taking place in Italy, the rest of Europe experienced the Medieval Times, more commonly known as the Dark Ages. The Dark Ages was one of the worst time periods in history, the main causes being war, famine, and a lot of bad diseases such as the Bubonic Plague, also known as “The Black Death”. It was during this time period that the Humanists emerged. These people had a different view of the world and saw things from a different perspective. They believed that people had important contributions to make the world a better place. Most of their ideas came from the ancient Greek and Romans, which inspired their new ideas to become even better.
